# Energy Routing Algorithm For Microgrid Clusters

This work has been presented at the 2020 Annual IEEE Texas Power and Energy Conference (TPEC) in Texas, USA and published [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9042508).

# Base Design

The simulation of individual microgrids working independently are provided in the following codes:

# Cluster Design

The independant microgrids are clustered and the energy routing is enabled using the Smart Energy Routing Algorithm which is given in the following code:

# Input Data

The load demand and the solar energy available for every hour for 20 years must be provided as inputs to the codes as .csv files.
